#Work experience is required
roles:
 - title: Sysadmin/DBA/Programmer/Networking/EverythingElse for a captive financing company
   start: 1996
   end: present
   employer: Myself
   description: Converted a Turbo Pascal financing program to C on AIX, then ended up administering their AIX systems, then ... too much to describe in detail, so... Informix DBA and scripting, Oracle DBA and scripting, PL/SQL, Korn and Bash shell scripting, Windows and Linux server admin, VMware, Azure... I'm sure I'm leaving stuff out... it's been almost a quarter century. Not a bad run for something that started as a six month contract. H/W, S/w, Databases.. pretty much everything. 
 - title: Miscellaneous
   start: 1996
   end: 2006
   employer: Myself
   description: Worked with a friend developing auto body shop s/w. At some point it spawned two different startups, but they both failed, because the startup owners were body shop people, not s/w peopl, and just didn't listen. We did that on and off for maybe a decade 
 - title: Contract position converting systems from DOS/VSE to MVS, designing/building new mainframe and client/server systems.
   start: 1989
   end: 1996
   employer: Some consulting company - the contract was at Cotter & Company
   description: MVS Assembler, learned Cobol just because it annoyed me that people said I couldn't do it because prior to that I'd refused to. Started doing Windows programming, networking and client/server there - remember Netware and WfW? Ended up going independent during this gig.
 - title: Programmer Analyst
   start: 1985
   end: 1988
   employer: Commonwealth Edison
   description: MVS Assembler, ISPF, Rexx - various Programmer Analyst sorts of things. Was in systems department - I don't even recall what it was officially called then _ "Computer Technical Analysis", I think, but we were doing everything, including MVS operating system exits. I developed a wide variety of things including some primitive mainframe version control software, and wrote developer utilities that enough of the department used that I was require to formalize them prior to leaving, so that they could continue to be used by everyone else.

#An additional info freetext section is optional at the bottom of the page - can be text or HTML
####additionalinfo: |
####   <strong>JVM</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have recently worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in addition to others.  In my current role Groovy is the primary language used - and I am familiar with many of the languages features and quirks (including writing <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-groovy">Functional Programming style groovy</a>). <br/><br/>
####   <strong>Web Development</strong>: My server side web development experience has largely been based on the Spring MVC framework (although current role uses ColdFusion for server side web stack). I have also worked with some client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS and have also experimented with other interesting technologies such as Backbone/Underscore/Require.<br/><br/>
####   <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar and Jenkins. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
####   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/Parse. <br/><br/>
####   As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
####   I write a blog covering technical and opinion articles that can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/">automateddeveloper.blogspot.com</a> (I am also a <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/users/899489/rhinds.html">DZone MVB</a>)
