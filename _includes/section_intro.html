			I sort of do everything. I've forgotten more environments and operating systems and hardware and languages than most people ever even hear of, much less learn or do. The reason for that is that is that I've been honestly interested in the evolution of computing since the late 1970's - it's all much simpler now, but back then it was being made from scratch, so there was much to learn along the way.
			<br />There were points in time in the early parts of my career where I was a deep expert in a few topics. Those days are history - I no longer claim to be an expert in anything - I do too many varying things on any given day now. But I have so much background, that I can usually guess my way into a new topic pretty well and get up to speed on it quickly.
			<br />I like Open Source - both the philosophy and software. I've been into that since the '90's, and have a sense of how that ecosystem is structured and behaves.
			<br />In short, I don't have a single, cohesive story. I have a history. If that interests you, then ask about anything, and I'll give you an honest answer. I don't hesitate to say "I don't know" if that's the case.
